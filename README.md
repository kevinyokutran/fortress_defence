# Fortress Defence

A simple game made in Java, similar to the Battleship board game. Players must find and eliminate all randomly generated enemies before your hp depletes. Each enemy takes up 4 tiles and are in tetra shaped positions.

Damages dealt per turn:
Enemy health 4 (full) = 20
Enemy health 3 = 4
Enemy health 2 = 3
Enemy health 1 = 2
Enemy health 0 = 0

This project was made using IntelliJ.
